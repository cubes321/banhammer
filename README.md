A little game where you an IRC op.  

Banhammer.py uses calls to the google ai studio api (2.0 flash for the 1500 requests) and therefore needs you to enter your API key.  Better conversation from this one.

The _local (cpu only) and _local2 (cuda or cpu) use a local llm that's downloaded on first use.  Runs but the conversation isn't exactly stimulating here.
